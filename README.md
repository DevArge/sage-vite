## Recomended libraries

- [ACF Composer](https://github.com/Log1x/acf-composer) for the advanced custom fields, (AFC Pro required)
- [Navi](https://github.com/Log1x/navi) Easy way to handle the WordPress menus, I also hate the WordPress NavWalker xD
- [Poet](https://github.com/Log1x/poet) provides simple configuration-based post type, taxonomy, editor color palette, block category, block pattern and block registration/modification.
